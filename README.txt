Hi,

This is the repository where I keep all my open source Python projects. Here are the various projects, by subdirectory:

RL-ADP_for_Network_Reinforcement/
		This is the final revision of the code used to show proof-of-concept for my thesis "Using Reinforcement Learning to Improve Network Durability". Please see http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Erik_Hammel/publication for all pertinent background information. The readme within this subdirectory gives comprehensive information on the project layout and purpose of each file.

More coming soon!
